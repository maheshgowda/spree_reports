Report List

Orders per Period
Sold Products
Configuration

The defaults are usually fine, but you can override them in an initializer. At least have a look at the country specific settings like time_zone and week_start.

initializers/spree_reports.rb

# reports to show
SpreeReports.reports = [
  :orders_by_period,
  :sold_products
]

# Time Zone: see http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/TimeZone.html
SpreeReports.time_zone = "Pacific Time (US & Canada)"

# Week Start Day: :mon or :sun
SpreeReports.week_start = :mon 

# Reports CSV exportable? true|false
SpreeReports.csv_export = true

# available months selection in reports
SpreeReports.report_months = %w{1 3 6 12 24 36 48 all}

# default months for reports
SpreeReports.default_months = 3

# default API user role to check, when accessing reports via API
SpreeReports.api_user_role = "admin"

# default date formats
SpreeReports.date_formats = {
  year: "%Y",
  month: "%m.%Y",
  week: "%W/%Y",
  day: "%m.%d.%y"
}

# e.g. override the day date_format
SpreeReports.date_formats[:day] = "%d.%m.%y"

# define user roles or users to exclude these users from reports
SpreeReports.excluded_roles = %w{admin}
SpreeReports.excluded_users = %w{name1@domain.com name2@domain.com}
API

To get data via the API, just copy the Permalink URL displayed at the bottom of each report and change the url from „admin/reports“ to „api/spree_reports“. Now you get the same data you can download on the report as CSV as JSON (you can use the same params here). Just append your spree user API token as url parameter or as request header as described here: https://guides.spreecommerce.com/api/summary.html

Example

# Permalink
http://localhost:3000/admin/reports/orders_by_period?group_by=week

# API URL
http://localhost:3000/api/spree_reports/orders_by_period?group_by=week&token=YOUR_KEY_HERE
Requirements

spree_core 2.2
ruby 2
Note about spree 2.2 spree_reports depends on the Spree::Store model which is new in 2.3. If you use spree 2.2, have a look at the multi-domain gem to make it work.
